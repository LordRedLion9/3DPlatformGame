Hey there.

This is is a Unity game project that I decided that I wanted to make in my spare time while at university.
Im going to try make a classic 3d platformer, similiar to somthing like Crash Bandicoot or maybe Banjo Kazooie. I didnt want to make some
boring 2d platformer for my first project, I wanted to make somthing that I knew I would like and that would keep me interested in making.

The hardest part about this project for me is going to be creating the art and models, since I dont have any experience with 3d modelling or texturing (or art in general), but Im going to
try my hardest anyway, but things will probably end up looking quite rough.

If anyone has suggestions, let me know.
